# letter_counting

Extract character/letters statistics from a list of words in Spanish (Or any other language)

## Purpose

We needed a quick way to check the statistics of `letter frequency` for spanish.

This notebook, also calculates a number of other variables, like 
    the lexic frequency, 
    phi (sum of relative frequency of each letter of a word), 
    rho (total strokes required to write a word)
    lenght (of the word)
